# C - Variables, if, else, while
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* Arithmetic operators, logic operators, boolean operators and relational operators.
* TRUE and FALSE values in C.
* Comments in C
* ASCII character set.
* Declaring and assigning variables.

## Technologies
* The C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* They have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

## Files
Note: All files are written in c programming language.

# C - Debugging
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages

## Technologies
* The c files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The c files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* Prototypes of functions are in [main.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/main.h)

# Files
Note: All files are written in c programming language.
| **Filename** | **Function of the file** |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| [0-main.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c) | Debug code to print an output of zero. |
| [1-main.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c) | Removing infinity loop in code. |
| [2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c) | Make code to print largest number accurately. |
| [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c) | Fixing the function that print remaining days |

# C - More Functions, more Nested Loops
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* What are nested loops and how to use them.
* What is a function and how do you use functions.
* The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
* What is a prototype.
* Scope of variables.
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89.
* What are header files and how to use them with #include.

## Technologies
* The c files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The c files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* Prototypes of functions are in [`main.h`](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/main.h)
* The [`_putchar.c`](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/_putchar.c) is used to wrire the character to `stdout`

## Files
Note: All files are written in c programming language.
| **Filename** | **Function of the file** |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| [0-isupper.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c) | Checks for uppercase character. |
| [1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c) | Checks for a digit (0 through 9). |
| [2-mul.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c) | Multiplies two integers. |
| [3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) | Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| [4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) | Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4, followed by a new line. |
| [5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) | Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| [6-print_line.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c) | Draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| [7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c) | Draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| [8-print_square.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c) | Prints a square, followed by a new line. |
| [9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c) | Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. |
| [10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c) | Prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| [100-prime_factor.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/100-prime_factor.c) | Finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. |
| [101-print_number.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/101-print_number.c) | Prints an integer. |

# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* What are pointers and how to use them.
* What are arrays and how to use them.
* The differences between pointers and arrays.
* Using strings and  manipulating them
* Scope of variables.

## Technologies
* The c files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The c files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

## Files
Note: All files are written in c programming language.
| **Filename** | **Function of the file** |
| -----------| -------------- |
| [0-reset_to_98.c]() | Takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. |
| [1-swap.c]() | Swaps the values of two integers. |
| [2-strlen.c]() | Returns the length of a string. |
| [3-puts.c]() | Prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| [4-print_rev.c]() | Prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [5-rev_string.c]() | Reverses a string. |
| [6-puts2.c]() | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| [7-puts_half.c]() | Prints half of a string, followed by a new line. |
| [8-print_array.c]() | Prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. |
| [9-strcpy.c]() | Copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. |
| [100-atoi.c]() | Converts a string to an integer. |
| [101-keygen.c]() | Generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. |

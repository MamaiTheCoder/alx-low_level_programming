# RECURSION

ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Enginnering course. It intends to give an insight on recursion and how to use it in c programming language

## Technologies
* C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
* C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra
## Files

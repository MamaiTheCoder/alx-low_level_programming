# Static Libraries
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* Understanding a static library.
* How static library works.
* How to create a static library.
* How to use a static library.

## Technologies
* C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.
* C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

## Files
Note: All files are written in c programming language.
| **Filename** | **Its Function** |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| [libmy.a](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/libmy.a) | Contains all the targeted functions. |
| [main.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/main.h) | Contains all the prototypes of the functions. |
| [create_static_lib.sh](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/create_static_lib.sh) | Creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files |

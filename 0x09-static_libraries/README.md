# C - STATIC LIBRARIES
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Enginnering course.
It give an undestanding of static libraries and the way they are used in c programming language.

## Technologies

* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
* C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

## Files
| **Filename** | **Function of the file** |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| [libmy.a]() | Contains all the targeted functions. |
| [main.h]() | Contains the prototypes of the functions. |
| [create_static_lib.sh]() | Creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory. |

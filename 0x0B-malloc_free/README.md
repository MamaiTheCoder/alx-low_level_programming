# C - malloc, free
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* The difference between automatic and dynamic allocation.
* What is malloc and free and how to use them.
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Technologies
* The c files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* Prototypes of functions are in [main.h]()

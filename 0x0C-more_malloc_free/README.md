# C - More malloc, free
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* How to use the `exit` function.
* Understanding `calloc` and `realloc` function from the standard library and how to use them.

## Technologies
* The c files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

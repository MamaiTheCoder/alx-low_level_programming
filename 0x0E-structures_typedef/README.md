# C - Structures, typedef
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* What are structures, when, why and how to use them?
* How to use typedef.

## Technologies
* The C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.

**NOTE:** All Files are written in C programming language.

## Header Files/C Files
| **Filename** | **Function of the File** |

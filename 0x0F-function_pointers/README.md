# C - Function pointers
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* Function pointers and how to use them.
* What function pointers hold.
* What function pointers point to in a virtual memory.

## Technologies
* The C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* The prototypes of the functions are in [function_pointers.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/function_pointers.h), excluding those for 3.{filenames} with are in [3-calc.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/3-calc.h) and 100-main_opcodes.c.

## Files
**NOTE:** All Files are written in C programming language.

| **Filename** | **Its function** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-print_name.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/0-print_name.c) | Prints a name. |
| [1-array_iterator.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/1-array_iterator.c) | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. |
| [2-int_index.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/2-int_index.c) | Searches for an integer. |
| [3-main.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/3-main.c), [3-op_functions.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/3-op_functions.c), [3-get_op_func.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/3-get_op_func.c), [3-calc.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/3-calc.h) | Performs simple operations. |
| [100-main_opcodes.c](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0F-function_pointers/100-main_opcodes.c) | Prints the opcodes of its own main function. |

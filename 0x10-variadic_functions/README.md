# C - Variadic functions
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* Variadic functions.
* Using `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` macros.
* The use of `const` type quantifier.

## Technologies
* The C files are written according to the C89 standard.
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* The prototypes are in [variadic_functions.h]().
## Files
**NOTE:** All files are written in C programming language.
| **Filename** | **Its Function** |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| [0-sum_them_all.c]() | Returns the sum of all its parameters. |
| [1-print_numbers.c]() | Prints numbers, followed by a new line. |

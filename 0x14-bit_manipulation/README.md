# C - Bit manipulation
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Engineering course.

## Learning Objectives
* The Feynman Learning Technique
* Binary, hexadecimal, and decimal numbers.

Technologies
* The C files were compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89
* They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04.
* The files have strictly followed [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding and documentation styles.
* The prototypes are in [main.h](https://github.com/MamaiTheCoder/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/main.h).

# Files
NOTE: All files were written in C programming language.
